Long-term we are planning to store the game metadata on-chain. The smartcontracts for EOSIO are already deployed on the WAX Testnet. You can check them [here](https://wax-test.bloks.io/account/blkdeveloper?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&account=blkdeveloper&scope=blkdeveloper&limit=100).

In order to launch the product faster, ensure good crosschain support and to ensure that we take enough time to audit and improve the contracts, we have decided to launch Smartcontract support down the road. It is something we are actively working on.

The launch of our smartcontracts will also allow you to sign the gamedata with your blockchain wallet and edit your game entity on the blockchain, without using any of our websites.
