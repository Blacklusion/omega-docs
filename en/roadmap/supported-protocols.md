title: Supported Protocols
description: Quidem magni aut exercitationem maxime rerum eos.

We have divided the rollout of new protocols into **4 phases + the Launch (Genesis Phase)**.

## Genesis (Current)
Part of the launch are two chains:
1. **WAX** (Alien Worlds, Blockchain Brawlers & 200+ more )
2. **EOS** (Upland ...)

Both chains are based on the EOSIO protocol and incorporate the AtomicAssets NFT standard. On request additional EOSIO-based chains can be integrated, if there is sufficient activity.

## Phase 1 (Q4 2022)
We will focus on preparing the support of widely adopted Ethereum standards such as ERC721 tokens. We will see the first two chains incorporating these standards. Currently, the following chains are planned:
1. **Ethereum**
2. **Binance Smart Chain** (may change)

## Phase 2 - 4
Additional protocols are to be announced. Phase 2 is set to complete in Q2 2023, bringing 2-3 new protocols to the platform. More specifics will be announced as the project progresses. Follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/blacklusion) to stay in the loop.
