## General Marketplaces
Instead of building another marketplace, we have decided to embrace already existing marketplaces and to give the user multiple options to view/buy an NFT. The user can select the desired marketplace via the marketplace-selector on the top of the NFT detail page. This selector is capped to a **total of 4 marketplaces per chain**. 

As we are not earning any revenue from NFT trading, we are auctioning off these prime spots, driving new users to your marketplace. 

If you would like to get your marketplace infront of our userbase, [contact us](https://t.me/blacklusion).

## Game-specific Marketplaces
Our mission is to offer the user a good user experience in the world of decentralized applications. One way we tackle this, is by helping the user to find all necessary information in a familiar UI that works crosschain. If you operate a game-specific marketplace, you would like to have integrated for a selected range of games, [contact us](https://t.me/blacklusion).
