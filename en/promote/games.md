## Optimize your game Listing (free)
Follow our game [listing guide](/en/starter-guide) and optimize your current listing. Especially updating your game description can not only improve the ranking on our platform but also help to convert users to players. Make sure to create an engaging description. Make use of our key feature option!

> Rule of Thumb: Supply as detailed information as possible without adding unnecessary or false information.

## Unreleased / upcoming Games (free)
We strongly believe that games should be ranked independent from e.g. NFT volume alone. Especially new project, that haven't had a NFT drop yet, can have a hard time creating an initial player base.

Make sure to add your socials and smartcontracts to your listing. This will ensure, our system can rank your game in categories other than NFT volume.

Your game will be automatically ranked as an "Upcoming" game, if the releasedate is set for the future.
