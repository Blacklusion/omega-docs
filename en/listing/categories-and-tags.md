description: Understand the difference between Game Categories and Tags
---
We use both Categories and Tags to organize games. This allows users to easily filter games and get better recommendations.

## Difference between Categories and Tags
### 1. Categories

= similar to a **traditional genre** e.g. action or strategy. 

They describe what type of gameplay to expect from a game. Categories can be chosen **freely** by the game publisher. 

### 2. Tags

= describes a certain **key feature of the game**, such as Play-To-Earn or Multichain. 

A tag doesn’t give any information about the style of playing. Tags are **protected** and require a successful verification process.

## Choosing Categories
Every game has a **primary Category and up to two additional categories**. For the primary category choose the category that describes the game the best. Whenever the game is shown throughout our UI, only the primary Category will be shown. 

For the additional categories, only choose categories that make sense. If no additional categories apply, don’t choose any additional categories, as choosing inapplicable categories can decrease the ranking of your game.

## Choosing Tags
> Work in progress, Information might change in the future

When applying for the verification of your game, you can apply for tags. The verification team might ask for additional information (e.g. when applying for the p2e tag, additional information about the tokenomics might be requested). If there is a valid reason for requesting a tag, our team will grant the tag, once the verification is done.
