We use a total of 4 different aspect ratios throughout the design. In the following, we will explain how each of these assets is used and how to get the most out of your branding. 

We have an optional photoshop template that helps you with the branding.

## Cover Vertically
This cover resembles the aspect ratio of a “traditional” game/book cover. It is used whenever a grid of games is shown, such as in the search or game tab. We recommend placing the text logo of your game on top of other game assets such as the main character of the game. If you have published other games under the same franchise, we recommend clearly stating the version on this Media type.

## Cover Horizontal
The Cover Horizontal is used instead whenever only a single line of games is shown. This asset offers slightly more space. You can create a variation of the Cover Vertically. However, to get the most out of your branding, we recommend choosing a completely different theme for both covers. This creates variety throughout the UI and can increase the click-through-rate.

## Cover Small
The Cover Small is used for the interesting section and for the floating navigation of the game details page. To get the most out of this asset we recommend following these principles
Only use the essentials of your logo
Use a background that contains a signature color/pattern of your game
Use a background that is not distracting. Keep in mind that this asset is displayed rather small.

## Logo
The logo is used for niche UI components such as in tables/rankings. The logo is always placed in a circular UI component. Make sure your logo is scaled in a way that no parts of the logo are cut off.

## Using the Photoshop Template
Optionally, you can use our Photoshop template. [Click to download](https://t.me/blacklusion)

1. Open it (other photo editors usually offer the option to open a photoshop file as well)
2. Place your media into all three canvases. 
3. Delete the folders with the name “DELETE ME” 
4. Export: The easiest way to export your media will be via File > Export > Quick Export as PNG (select a folder and all three canvases will be exported at once)
