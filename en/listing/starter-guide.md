## New or Existing game?

Once you are logged into your account, head over to the games section and **click on add new or existing game**. You can now choose between two different starting points:

### 1. Existing Game

A game can be managed by multiple people (e.g. marketing team and developer team). Hence, the game might already exist on-chain, but your user account has not been associated with the game yet. If you would like to make changes to an existing game (e.g. it was already registered by your colleague), choose this as a starting point.

### 2. New Game
Only choose this option if you are listing a completely new game, that has not been registered by one of your colleagues.

2. **Game Name**: The full game name with spaces and lower/uppercase letters
3. **Primary Category**: The category that describes the game the best
4. **Additional Categories**: Select upto two additional categories. Read our article about [Category Dos and Donts here](/en/categories-and-tags)

6. **Foundingyear**: The year your gaming department / company was founded. The founding year will be checked during the verification process

## Chain Data
### Why is Chain Data needed?
We use different types of metrics to rank games. These can be simple metrics such as the NFT volume or more complex metrics such as unique player accounts or social metrics. To monitor these metrics and create statistics we need additional information about the game, especially about the smart-contracts and nft collection.

### What Chain Data is needed?
The information can differ between different chain protocols:
1. NFT standard (e.g. atomic assets)
2. NFT Collection name 
3. Smart contracts (this is a list of smart contracts that are used by your game. If your game uses multiple smart contracts, list all of them)

### Chain Data & Multichain
Project Omega was designed from the ground up for multichain. The same game can be apparent on multiple chains. If this is the case, chain data is requested for every chain independently, as it may differ between the chains.
